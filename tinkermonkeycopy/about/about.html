      <div class="blob">
        We started Tinkering Monkey as a way to create things we believe have meaning and longevity. In today’s disposable world, we find passion in creating something that will be cherished for years to come.
      </div>
      <div class="blob">
        We love that each sign that goes out our doors has its own unique character. We put the same effort into every sign as if it were our own, and we find ourselves just as excited finishing today’s signs as we were with our first.

    <h1> OUR STUDIO</h1>
    <span>Tinkering Monkey is located in a 100 year old brick-and-timber warehouse space in Berkeley, California. The building housed a bank in the 1950’s, with the original cast iron vault still operational. In 6 short years, we’ve gone from one car garage to a 3,000 sq ft warehouse. See our space »
